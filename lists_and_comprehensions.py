#LISTS (26PTS TOTAL)
#In these exercises you should should use functions as needed.  All functions should have comments to describe their purpose.



# PROBLEM 1 (Using List Comprehensions - 6pts)
# Use the list comprehension method to do the following:
# a) Make a list of numbers from 1 to 100
# b) Make a list of even numbers from 20 to 40
# c) Make a list of squares from 1 to 100 (1 ** 2 to 100 ** 2)


#PROBLEM 2 (8-ball - 5pts)
# A magic 8-ball, when asked a question, provides a random answer from a list.
# The code below contains a list of possible answers. Create a magic 8-ball program that
# prints a random answer.
answer_list = [ "It is certain", "It is decidedly so", "Without a \
doubt", "Yes, definitely", "You may rely on it", "As I see it, \
yes", "Most likely", "Outlook good", "Yes", "Signs point to yes",
"Reply hazy try again", "Ask again later", "Better not tell you \
now", "Cannot predict now", "Concentrate and ask again", "Don ' t \
count on it", "My reply is no", "My sources say no", "Outlook \
not so good", "Very doubtful" ]


# PROBLEM 3 (Shuffle - 5pts)
# A playing card consists of a suit (Heart, Diamond, Club, Spade) and a value (2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,J,Q,K,A).
# Create a list of all possible playing cards, which is a deck.
# Then create a function that shuffles the deck, producing a random order.  
# Hmmm... I wonder if python already has a way to randomly shuffle a list...


# PROBLEM 4 (Illinois Pick 4 - 10pts)
# Lotteries are known to give awful odds of winning, and incredibly low expected returns on your invevestment.
# You will buy 10000 Illinois Pick 4 tickets in a simulation.
# Make a 2d lists of your picks.  Each number is a random 0 to 9.
# After you have made a list of 10000 lists (each 4 long), you will draw the official numbers
# After drawing the official numbers, you will go back through your list and check to see how many wins you got.
# The numbers must be an exact match in the exact position.
# Each ticket is $1.  If you win, you get $5000.  Simulate spending $10,000 on Pick 4 tickets, and see your return.
